    # using the myTunnel_forward action on the port connected to the next switch.

    # For our simple topology, switch 1 and switch 2 are connected using a
    # link attached to port 2 on both switches. We have defined a variable at
    # the top of the file, SWITCH_TO_SWITCH_PORT, that you can use as the output
    # port for this action.
    #
    # We will only need a transit rule on the ingress switch because we are
    # using a simple topology. In general, you'll need on transit rule for
    # each switch in the path (except the last switch, which has the egress rule),
    # and you will need to select the port dynamically for each switch based on
    # your topology.

    # connected to.
